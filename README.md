Hide IP and ISP - speedtest.net
This script blurs your IP, ISP as well as the sponsor. This is to help prevent leaking your IP. If you want to do the default preset with a tool such as "CSS override", please do:

.js-sponsor-name, .js-data-sponsor, .js-data-isp, .js-data-ip, .ispComponent, .server-current {

This version is easily customizable and generates the CSS. There is an alternative version which is purely CSS.
